# Hello-World-
This world is going to be a magical portal that will enhance my perception in order to achieve full creative control over this device. 
The ultimate product of the physical sciences is the computer; the ultimate product of human creation is the brain: by mastering the brain, one can master the technical replication of it as well. 
This brand new world of understanding and engineering the cyber "brain" will be a journey that coincides with my yoga practice. Yoga simply means Union. The union of body and mind is very present in the work of anything that involves a computer; a union that is not present in most of us, despite the intense relationship we have with PCs.

So here we go--starting from scratch. What's Java? What's a computer? What's a brain? How can master it?
